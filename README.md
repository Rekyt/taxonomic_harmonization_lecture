[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.7417951.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7417951)


This repo contains material for an hour and a half lecture on taxonomic harmonization, which is the process to 'align' differents datasets on a similar taxonomy prior to merging them.

The lecture was developed and given in the context of the NFDI4Biodiversity and GfÖ joint Winter School 2022.


## :clipboard: Content summary

This course aims to give first clues about taxonomic harmonization and how to deal with it. Giving the following points:

* What is taxonomy and how does it work?
* What are taxonomic reference databases and their different types?
* What is taxonomic harmonization and why is it needed?
* Where to start when trying to harmonize the taxonomy of datasets?
* Some practical considerations when performing taxonomic harmonization: considering author names, fuzzy matching, and larger databases.

Then there are several other interesting resources:

* [`taxharmonizexplorer`](https://mgrenie.shinyapps.io/taxharmonizexplorer/) the companion shiny app that displays a network of searchable taxonomic resources
* [`gnparser`](https://parser.globalnames.org/) one of the parser suggested to parse taxonomic names
* [the GBIF name parser](https://www.gbif.org/tools/name-parser) another name parsing tool useful to preprocess taxonomic names
* [Global Names Verifier](https://verifier.globalnames.org/) one of these "mega-aggregator" database that contains many other databases to search for unmatched names
